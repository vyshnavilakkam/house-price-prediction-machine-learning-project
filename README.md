House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project 🏡
This project predicts house prices based on various features using machine learning models such as Linear Regression.

Project Overview 📊
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on a dataset that includes features like:

Number of Bedrooms 🛏
Square Footage 📐
Location 📍
Year Built 🏗
The objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house given its features.

Features 🛠
Prediction Model:
Linear Regression 🧮
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared. 📈
Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, handled for missing values, and feature scaling is applied for better model performance. ⚙
Model Comparison: Evaluating different machine learning models to identify the best one. 🏆
Visualization: Visualizing the relationship between features and house prices using Matplotlib. 📊
